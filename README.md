# project Cal

NO AI

In this Project I shall be attempting to make a Calculator

with these goals in mind Number 1 modular I want it to be in in multiple classes all connecting to main he calculator will have:

* UI basic will copy apple.
* It will have a display.
* will add  addition subtraction divison and multiplication.
* Must be modular should connect to a main *3 should all be in 1 class.
* At the end add formulas.

But first make P3,then reevaluate and use super and stuff like that.
P3 done next I will connect it to main class.

Next I will begin the UI bit but first add to github.

options for UI

 1. javafx most uptodate but kind of annoying
 2. swing
 3. springboot

I shall go with jafafx just cause

I have completed the buttons 

next Is to make the display,then implement Core and add a selected convertor to core it will need to change a string text into a useable int bits
